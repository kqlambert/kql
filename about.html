		<p>Iâ€™m a full stack developer with over six years experience building and designing websites spanning multiple industries. My experience has been built in both team and individual environments, building responsive, cross-browser friendly websites. I pride myself on being able to learn new concepts/best practices and programming languages quickly. I have a beautiful 5 year old daughter and drop-dead beautiful wife. I am also an infantryman with U.S. Army National Guard.</p>
		<p>Currently available for both contract and full time projects, on or off site. I can take projects from concept to launch with a team or alone, and I love to be in fast-paced workplaces.</p>
